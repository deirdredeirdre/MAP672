    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p>I want to start with some general thoughts I had while reading the manifesto.  I was intrigued by the paraphrased quote from Jeremy Crampton regarding the connection of critical mapping with power.  Professionally, I am an administrator but fundamentally I am an archivist.  In my field, there is great discussion about the power and therefore the responsibility that comes with being an archivist.  We are the individuals that decide what cultural markers (texts, photographs, records, and yes even maps) are saved.  If they aren’t saved, they will never be part of our cultural memory.  The cultural marker may exist in collective memory for as long as the people who experienced are alive but without the persistence of the information through evidence it will be lost in time.  The connection of these two forms of power is interesting to me.</p>

<p>Pondering this, reminded me of my second passion - photography.  A photograph is created based on the vision of its maker.  The things we leave out, the lighting, the perspective all influence how it is interpreted or the emotion it elicits.  As an archival record, the photograph must be evaluated based on any known biases that can be considered.  This is much like a map and its inherent biases based on subjectivity and desires of its maker.</p>

<p>I don’t know were I would situate myself in this world of maps.  I have no background in geography to inform my leanings to cartographer, coder, or critic.  I feel drawn to last two.  I am interested in some sort of intersection of information science and geography but my background in fine arts drives an aesthetic desire as well.</p>

<p>Manifesto point 3 resonated with me.  With digital technologies, media, or platforms it is important to dissolve the boundaries between analog and digital so that focus can be on the content/context to allow for question, growth, and understanding.
